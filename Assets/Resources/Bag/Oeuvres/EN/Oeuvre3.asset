  questionG: Take a good look at the loom and the work, according to you in what
    sense is the Aubusson tapestry woven?
  descriptionG: 'Aubusson''s tapestry is based on an image prepared by a cardboard
    painter. The weaving is carried out manually by a weaver on the reverse side
    of the tapestry, using hand-dyed wool: a demanding process with significant production
    times and cost. Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009, Aubusson tapestries
    are a benchmark worldwide.'
  questionD: What does fallen from trade mean?
  descriptionD: It is the expression used to designate the final phase of the creation
    of the tapestry. It is the moment when the threads are cut which connects the
    tapestry to the loom and thus make the tapestry "fall", allowing for the first
    time to discover it as a whole and in place.
