  title: Summer
  date: (1907-1997)
  author: Dom Robert
  materials: Low smooth tapestry, wool and cotton
  reference: "Cardboard from 1941. \nTissage Atelier Tabard, Aubusson, 1947, ex. 5,
    \n224x328 cm. \nLoan from the Cit\xE9 International de la Tapisserie. Aubusson,
    inv no.2006.7.1"
  questionG: It's funny how Dom Robert interpreted fauna and flora!
  descriptionG: 'The tapestry includes the main themes that Dom Robert will later
    decline: farmyard animals, trees, flowers and butterflies. The ovoid shape containing
    the central scene will become one of the characteristics of his compositions.'
  questionD: "Was the space built by another artist who inspired Dom Robert, Jean
    Lur\xE7at?"
  descriptionD: "Here, the palette proposed by Jean Lur\xE7at is chosen: green-blue
    background and large mass of deep red on which the whites and yellows stand out.
    The red border and the inscription in the cartouche at the bottom right connect
    this work to the illumination and the medieval tapestry."
