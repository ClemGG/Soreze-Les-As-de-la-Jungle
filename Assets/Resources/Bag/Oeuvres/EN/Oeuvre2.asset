  questionG: What animals are found in this tapestry?
  descriptionG: We can observe 7 fish, some shrimp, a small flat fish and 2 hermit
    crabs, one of which, if you look closely, with a rather strange hat. It is that
    of the bishop called the miter, mentioned in shell in this tapestry.
  questionD: According to you, how many hours of weaving did it take to finish this
    tapestry?
  descriptionD: For this tapestry of almost 6 square meters and due to its finesse,
    the weaving took more than 1,200 hours, to which must be added 250 hours of sewing.
    That is almost 1,500 hours in all and this over 7 months.
