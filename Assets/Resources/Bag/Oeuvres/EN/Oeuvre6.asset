  questionG: Can you recognize one of Dom Robert's favorite themes that we find a
    lot in his works?
  descriptionG: The farmyard is one of Dom Robert's favorite themes. Here, the ducks
    form a circle in the middle of a flowered meadow of poppies, umbels and sorrels.
    Dom Robert was inspired by a farm around the monastery in which he lived, which
    explains the name of the work.
  questionD: At what age did Dom Robert make this work?
  descriptionD: Dom Robert will be 80 years old when he creates this box. He still
    willingly takes his bike when the weather is good to go and draw the surrounding
    countryside. This work demonstrates his perfect mastery of composition and technique.
